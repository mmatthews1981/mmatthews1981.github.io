	<p>Do you ever wish you had more profanity in your posts? Install this plugin, and you can tell off all sorts of people in all sorts of ways! WP-FOAAS gives you the API-powered power to tell people to f*ck off, dynamically!</p>
	<p>This plugin connects you to the API provided by <a href="http://www.foaas.com/">foaas.com</a>, but don't blame them, they actually had nothing to do with this.</p>

	<h3><a href="https://github.com/mmatthews1981/kill-in-feed">Kill In Feed</a></h3>
	<p>This plugin gives you two new shortcodes, [killinfeed] and [addtofeed], that will prevent whatever it's wrapped around from being included in your site's RSS feed, or add exclusive feed-only content, in that order. </p>

	<h3><a href="https://github.com/mmatthews1981/kolcyoa">KOLCYOA</a></h3>
	<p>A choose-your-own-adventure proof of concept, based on a Kingdom of Loathing pdf, found <a href="http://images.kingdomofloathing.com/cyoa/">here</a>. Concept proved? Dynamic content can be served in the admin dashboard.</p>
