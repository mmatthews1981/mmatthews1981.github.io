	<h2>Past Projects</h2>
	<p>Here we have a collection of my most interesting projects, out of the hundreds of sites I've fixed, built and launched over the years. If you'd like more examples, feel free to <a href="mailto:mr.lynn.matthews@gmail.com">contact me</a>. They won't be nearly as interesting, but there sure are a lot of them.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://repcapitalmedia.com">Reputation Capital Media</a></h3>
	<h4>Remote Contract Developer</h4>
	<em>2011 to present</em>
	<p>Development, internal ops tech support and implementation, project specs, consultation, and copywriting. I started working as a freelancer with Mary Ellen Slayter 6 days after she signed her first client. In that time, I've worked on countless development projects for her clients as well as provided operational tech support and implementation internally. A list of client projects is available upon request. </p>

	<h3><a href="http://smartblogs.com">Smart Blogs</a></h3>
	<h4>Remote Contract Developer</h4>
	<em>2011 to 2014</em>
	<p>Frontend and backend development, advanced MySQL development, advanced WordPress development. I've worked on and off with Smart Blogs on a variety of projects, mostly having to do with their smartblogs.com website. The biggest project I did with them involved taking their website, which was in reality a WordPress Multisite with many subsites on it, and integrating all of the different content nodes back into a single installation of WordPress while maintaining the content structure, authors, SEO, content, and comments.I then developed a content-aware theme for their site that adjusts ads and styling depending on what a user is reading. </p>

	<h3>
		<a href="http://www.capitalimpact.org/">Capital Impact</a> 
		and 
		<a href="http://affordableownership.org">Cornerstone Partnership</a>
	</h3>
	<h4>Remote Contract Developer</h4>
	<em>2012 to 2015</em>
	<p>Frontend development, backend development, project spec, advanced WordPress development. Work with Capital Impact has mainly fallen into two categories: front-end WordPress development for capitalimpact.org, and back-end development on affordableownership.org. Both sites were relaunches, but due to the sheer size of affordableownership.org and the fact that they're constantly adding new information and data types to it, affordableownership.org has become a much more complex project overall, functioning more like a portal than a regular website.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://mchapusa.com/mychap-app/">Chapp App</a></h3>
	<h4>Remote Contract Developer</h4>
	<em>2014</em>
	<p>Mobile WordPress, advanced WordPress development. I've worked on and off with the Eastco Group, providing development services for their clients. This project was the first time I've ever seen WordPress implemented as a mobile app, thanks to Eastco's implementation. The app functions as a resource for HR departments to find corporate chaplains assigned to various locations nationwide. The app automatically pulls in chaplain data from a third-party database and provides contact information as well as methods. This app has been released for both android and apple devices. </p>

	<h3><a href="http://honors.uconn.edu">Honors.UConn.Edu</a></h3>
	<h4>Remote Contract Developer</h4>
	<em>2012</em>
	<p>The Honors department of the University of Connecticut needed 6 child themes and a parent theme for their sub-departments, coded according to their wishes, in accordance with the University design and accessibility guidelines, and without plugins, due to their highly modified, system-wide multisite installation.

			<li>premed.uconn.edu</li>
